### Project: Doc'IT

Doc’it provides a centralised platform for authorised staff from small family clinics
to view, update, and onboard patient records and schedule appointments, solving the
inefficient paper records and files used today. With Doc’it, small family clinics can
reduce man-hours in managing paper files, translating this ‘saved’ time into better
frontline care services.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the Prescription class
    * What it does: allows the user to record down prescriptions given to the patient.
    * Justification: This allows medical professions to record down prescriptions provided to patients during each appointment. It also allows them to check past prescription history of patient.
    * Highlights: This enhancement requires careful navigation of nested lists structures and modifying the storage serializer to deal with this structure.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2122s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=true&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other&since=2021-09-17&tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&tabAuthor=rish-16&tabRepo=AY2122S1-CS2103-W14-1%2Ftp%5Bmaster%5D&authorshipIsMergeGroup=false&authorshipFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code&authorshipIsBinaryFileTypeChecked=false)

* **Project management**:
    * Managed releases `v1.1` - `v1.4` (4 releases) on GitHub

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
    * Wrote additional tests for existing features to increase coverage from 66% to 76% (Pull requests [\#59](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-W14-1/tp/pull/59), [\#277](https://app.codecov.io/gh/AY2122S1-CS2103-W14-1/tp/compare/277?src=pr&el=continue&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=github&utm_content=comment&utm_campaign=pr%20comments&utm_term=AY2122S1-CS2103-W14-1))

* **Documentation**:
    * User Guide:
        * Added documentation for the features `add prescription` and `delete prescription` [\#72](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-W14-1/tp/pull/181)
    * Developer Guide:
        * Written target user profile, value proposition and user stories. [\#37](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-W14-1/tp/pull/37)
        * Created Plant-UML diagrams for `prescription` class.'[\#72](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-W14-1/tp/pull/181)
        * Added implementation details of the `prescription` feature. [\#72](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-W14-1/tp/pull/181)

* **Community**:
    * PRs reviewed (with non-trivial review comments): [\#44](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-W14-1/tp/pull/44), [\#282](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-W14-1/tp/pull/282)
    * Contributed to forum discussions (examples: [1](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2122S1/forum/issues/174), [2](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2122S1/forum/issues/195), [3](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2122S1/forum/issues/325))
    * Reported bugs and suggestions for other teams in the class (examples: [1](https://github.com/huyuxin0429/ped/issues/8), [2](https://github.com/huyuxin0429/ped/issues/4), [3](https://github.com/huyuxin0429/ped/issues/9))

* **Testing**:
  * Designated as main tester for team, in charge of testing and finding ways to break our app.
  * Contributed to more than 42% of all bug related issues raised for team. (examples: [1](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-W14-1/tp/issues/259), [2](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-W14-1/tp/issues/257), [3](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-W14-1/tp/issues/157))
  * Emphasize on KISS design principle to team during high level design meetings.
  * Input validation: Implemented more restrictive general parsing to reduce likelihood of unintended inputs. [\#232](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-W14-1/tp/pull/232/files)
  * Introduced more restrictive parsing guidelines for prescriptions. [\#256](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103-W14-1/tp/pull/274)
  * Initiated discussion on forum regarding sustainable testing rigor across development life cycle. ([Link here](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2122S1/forum/issues/325))
